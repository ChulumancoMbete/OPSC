# Open Source Coding (Introduction) (OPSC7311)

This repository contains the example code for OPSC7311.

Each Learning Unit has its own folder. And tags have been created so you can checkout code up to a specific section in the module manual.

For the app in Learning Unit 4, you need to:

1. Sign up for a Firebase account if you don't have one yet.
2. Create a new project using the Firebase console at https://console.firebase.google.com/
3. Connect the app to the project using Android Studio.

Read Learning Unit 4 Section 2 of the Module Manual for more information.
